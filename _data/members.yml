  bio: I am now a member of Functional Genomics Laboratory. I want understand how living creatures aging and how retard it. To understand the matters, I'm trying to compile and mine bio-big-data. From 2007, I was trained for analyzing microarray data. My current research focus is on chronological aging process as well as longevity (e.g. Caloric Restriction) machanism in mice major tissues and yeast cells.
